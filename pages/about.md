# Hello 

Hi, I'm Toma Brasoveanu (the biggest and most annoying film nerd ever)! It's 11/8/2024 right now, and I decided the world needs to see my opinions about movies, because seemingly no one agrees with them, like most movie critics. So, to provide the world to listen to one more person talk about and completely sway your opinion of a movie before you even see it, I've decided to post one movie (or television show) critique a week. But, since I'm starting today after already seeing around 150 movies, this week I will post 4 movie critiques and one television show critiques (please don't hold me to that).
